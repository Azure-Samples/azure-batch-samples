### BatchMetrics

The BatchMetrics sample project demonstrates how to efficiently call the Azure Batch API
in order to monitor job progress.

This sample application demonstrates the following operations:

1. Selecting specific attributes in order to download only the fields you need
2. Filtering on state transition times in order to download only changes

The sample includes a library project which you can incorporate into your own projects
and a simple command line program to exercise and demonstrate the use of the library.

Diameter of the Moon
Purpose
To calculate the diameter of the Moon using
proportions.

Background
The diameter of the Moon is proportional to the diameter of a cardboard disk, given that
you know the distance to the Moon and the distance to the cardboard disk.
The relationship is:
d
l

D
L

so that:
D = L(d/l)
where

D
d
L
l

= diameter of Moon
= diameter of cardboard disk
= distance to Moon
= distance to cardboard disk

In this activity, students will measure d and l. They will be given L.
They will calculate D.
The diameter of the Moon (D) is 3,476 km.

Preparation
Review and prepare materials listed on the student sheet.
Choose a day and location for this activity which is best for viewing a full Moon.
A cardboard disk of 2 cm diameter works well. Better accuracy may be achieved by
using a larger disk, thus a greater distance l. However, if obtaining or cutting cardboard
is difficult, then this activity can also be done with dimes. A dime held out at arm's
length will cover the Moon.
The distance from Earth to the Moon for a given date can be obtained by asking a local
planetarium staff, Or for this activity, students may use an average value of
382,500 km.

Diameter of the Moon
In Class
If students work in pairs, then one student can use the string to measure distance from
their partner's eye to the disk.
The same units do not have to be used on both sides of the equation, but d and l have to
be the same units. The D will be the same unit as L.

Wrap-Up
To compute the density of the Moon use the diameter to compute volume and use the
mass value of 7.35 x 1022 kg.
Density of the Moon is 3.34 grams/cubic cm.

Key Words

Procedure

proportional

1. On a day when you can see the Moon: place a
cardboard disk on top of a stake or on a
window sill so that it exactly covers the Moon
from your point of view behind the cardboard
disk.

Materials
2-cm wide cardboard disk
wooden stake (optional)
meter stick
calculator
string

2. Have a friend measure the distance from
your eye to the cardboard disk.
Call this distance l and write the value here:
l=
3. The distance from Earth to the Moon varies
between 360,000 km and 405,000 km. Find the
distance for todayâ€™s date or use an average value
for your calculations of 382,500 km.
Write the value that you are going to use here:
L=
4. What is the diameter of the cardboard disk?
d=

5. The diameter of the Moon is proportional to the
diameter of your cardboard disk by this equation:
d D
l L

where: D
d
L
l

so that, D = L(d/l)

= diameter of Moon
= diameter of cardboard disk
= distance to Moon
= distance to cardboard disk

Diameter of the Moon
Results
1. By your calculations, the diameter of the Moon is:
D=
2. Compare your result with the accepted diameter of the Moon.
How close did you get?

3. How many times smaller is the diameter of the Moon than the
diameter of Earth?

4. When you calculated the diameter of the Moon, did you have to
use the same units on both sides of the equation?

5. How and where could you find the value for the distance to the
Moon for today's date?

6. What else would you need to know to compute the density of the
Moon? Try it.
